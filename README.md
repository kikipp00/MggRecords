# Mgg Records

## Overview
This is an application that, provided with a user id, will collect 
information from all the books in their lists and write the book 
information into a csv (one for each list).

Website GUI is a work-in-progress.

## Purpose
Mgg has no way for the user to backup their lists. This application
serves as a way to keep a record of their lists in case of the future
(e.g. the not-unlikely possibility of the site being shut down).

## Warning
This application scrapes data from mgg. Do not use this
application maliciously and be well aware of what you are doing
before executing or modifying the program. If not, you may risk
getting banned from mgg.
